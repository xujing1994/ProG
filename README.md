This is a **polished project** inspired by the work of the paper: Xiangguo Sun, Hong Cheng, JIa Li,
etc. [All in One: Multi-task Prompting for Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01504). KDD2023. The Raw Codes are released [Here](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/mpg/README.md)


This repository is a **polished version** of the raw codes with **[Extremely Huge Changes and Updates](https://github.com/sheldonresearch/ProG/blob/main/History.md#13-jul-2023)**. See the differences [Here](https://github.com/sheldonresearch/ProG/blob/main/History.md#13-jul-2023).
