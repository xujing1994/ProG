This is a **polished project** inspired by the work of the paper: Xiangguo Sun, Hong Cheng, JIa Li,
etc. [All in One: Multi-task Prompting for Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01504). KDD2023. The Raw Codes are released at [https://anonymous.4open.science/r/mpg/README.md](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/mpg/README.md)


This repository is a polished version of the raw codes with **Extremely Huge Changes and Updates**. Please check this link to see the differences: [https://github.com/sheldonresearch/ProG/releases](https://github.com/sheldonresearch/ProG/releases)
